				<h2>General History.</h2>
				<p>Gorey is a very historic town. There are many myths and tales about what happpened and why certain things are the way they are in the town. You will be sure to hear of some of these stories should you go for a pint in one of our traditionl pubs or even just get talking to someone on the main street. Being from the town I have heard many a tale about what went on back in the day. I have heard stories of the infamous "pot lane" and the notorious hurling street leagues taht were lpayed between the young lads and taken very seriously. From what I've heard there was a hefty cash prize for the winners!. However, aside from these beautiful stories I have to say that the history of Gorey is actually quite interesting. All you have to do is take a 5 minute drive out to a place called Craanford where you can visit a 17th century corn mill!. One of the most historic things in the South East however is situated right at the top of the town. "The monument" as it's called by locals is steeped in history from top to bottom. It could be described as a freestanding rope twist-detailed cut-limestone Celtic High Cross-style monument, dated 1898, on inscribed cut-granite pedestal on stepped base. Street fronted on a wedge shaped island site. The monument is known to have been erected by the people of North Wexford for the martyrs of 1798. The Catholic church of Gorey is also very historic. Back when the penal laws were being enforced, the Catholics of Gorey had a very hard time. The thatched church at Gorey bridge was bured down which was unfortunately no exception at the time. This left the catholics with no place of worship, it didn't end there though. They were also banned from practicing their religion within the boundaries of the town. This is when the parishes of Gorey and Kilanerin, a neighbouring parish became one and it stayed that way until 1845. The marriage and baptismal registers were kept in kilanerin with the preists who lived there and it is said that there are many many intriguing records in them however unfortunately I havent't had the privelage of reading them.</p>

				<p>Sure, all of these various tales and stories about the town are very interesting. However, I'm sure that this isn't unique to Gorey and is the same in almost every town. After all, us Irish love a good story!. However, there is something in the history of the town I find very, very interesting. This is the growing population and while you may think yeah, every town in Irelans is growing in population and I'm sure thats the case, the population in Gorey is so high for such a small town and it just keeps on growing without any sign of stopping.</p>

				<table style="width:50%">
					<tr>
						<th>Population of Gorey</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>1996</td>
						<td>3,939</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>2002</td>
						<td>5,282</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>2006</td>
						<td>7,193</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>2011</td>
						<td>9,114</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>2016</td>
						<td>9,822</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<p>As you can see from the table above, the population of Gorey has almost tripled in as little as 20 years. For a population to grow this exponentially is such a weird thing to happen, especially in Ireland where our overall population is quite low. However, it did happen in Gorey and you would imagine that the main reason for this is that people are spilling out from Dublin to the outter areas. However, a lot of this population growth is also down to the amount of accomodation that became available to people due to the growing footprint of the town.</p>
