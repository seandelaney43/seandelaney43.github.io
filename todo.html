				<p>Undoubtely there are many things to do and see both in the town of Gorey and in its near surroundings.  For example, there is the Gorey monument, a site you should visit, adventure alley, a great spot for some fun on the trampolines! or Pirates Cove, for all your bowling needs. Obviously some places are better than others and the following are my favourite places to go in order of preference:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Breakers Pool&Snooker club</li>
					<br>
					<li>Pirates Cove</li>
					<br>
					<li>Tara Hill for a walk</li>
				</ol>

				<p>No matter what you're in to, be it sport, photography, science or anything at all, you can be sure that there is something for you!. For the sporty ones, there are multiple gyms about such as the worx gym and the ashdown leisure club. There is also an almost endless supply of sports clubs for you to test out. For anyone who is in to photography or just anyone who likes going on relaxing walks through scenic countryside there are many locations for you, Tara Hill for example, is 5 minutes outside of the town and offers breathtaking views and and a chance to stretch out your legs. Or why not take a trip to courtown, another 5 minute drive where you can walk along beaches that stretch in to woodland and snap some shots of one of the most photogenic places in the county.</p>
