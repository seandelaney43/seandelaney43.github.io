				<h2>Niall "Boom Boom" Kennedy</h2>
				<img id="peopleimg" src="Assets/Images/boomboom.jpg" alt="picture of Niall Kennedy">
				<p>Niall "Boom Boom" Kennedy is a professional boxer from Gorey. Niall is a 34 year old guard from the town of Gorey. He fights in the heavyweight division and is very well decorated for such a short career. He made his professional debut on 01/05/2015 and now has a record of 12 wins, 0 losses and just the 1 draw (12-0-1). Niall is an up and coming fighter without a doubt and can't stop impressing the people of his local town. To be fair, having only fought 13 times as a professional, it is hard to believe how quickly boom booms career has progressed. On his last fight, he fought on an undercard for a Billy Joe Saunders fight. Billy Joe is a very well known fighter who has been around for a few years and is a well knwon name so this was magnificent for Niall. Niall used to be a great footballer for Naomh Eanna too so I've heard but unfortunately had to give up the football to focus on his lifelong dream. Niall has also trained with some big names. Not too long ago, Niall was in camp Joshua as he prepared to fight Wladimir Klitschko. Joshua had nothing but praise for the Gorey man saying he was a tough fighter and he even went as far to say that he would like to have Niall back again to train some time. Niall truly is a great sportsman who works his very hardest to live his dream life. Balancing working as a guard with being a professional sportsperson surely isn't an easy task and something that you have to give Niall great credit for. He is a brilliant role model for any young person who wants to follow in his steps and here in Gorey we have a feeling that he's only getting started.</p>

				<h2>Conor Mcdonald</h2>

				<img src="Assets/Images/mac.jpg" alt="Conor McDonald" id="peopleimg">
				<p>Conor McDonald is arguably the most famous sports star to come from Gorey in recent times. The 23 year old has been in the limelight for Wexford hurling for qite some time now and he doesn't seem to be going anywhere. McDonad hurls with his local club Naomh Eanna and is one of their most important players if you were to pick one. Conor has been nominated for an all-star award in the past however he missed out on the win, probably because of his age at a crisp 21. The young man always seemed to excell for Wexford, displaying talent from a young age and most notably for the wexford under 21 hurlers when he combined with Cathal Dunbar, also a Gorey man for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Zo0cX3bdk">that</a> goal that we've all seen multiple times in many a highlight reel. McDonald won his first ever semior hurling title this year with Naomh Eanna and he played a huge part in that victory scoring two goals from play. One of the most unbelievable facts about McDonald is the age that he started playing county hurling at. He actually first pplayed county hurling for the yellow bellies when he was 15, the amazing thing though was that he was playing for the minor team (under 18). He has since taken a firm claim to the  seninor teams full forward line and hasn't been out of the first 15 much since making his senior debut in 2013. As of April 2017 McDonald had score a total of 14 goals and 134 points over 20 appearances for his county and this has only risen since. Despite his talent however, Conor isn't the most decorated player you will ever come across. He currently holds one club senior medal and three Leinster All-Irelands with Wexford in 2013, 2014 and 2015. McDonald went to college in UCD before eventually moving in to DIT to complete his studies.</p>
