				<p id="leftcontent">Gorey is a large town in the South-East of the country. It is considered a "commuter town" to Dublin. This means that not only is the town a short drive from the countries capital, it also has quite a large population due to this. The town had a population of 9,822 people in 2016 and I would suspect that this number has only risen substancially since. The town itself is quite a large town in terms of acutal geographical size and is one of the largest towns in the county. It is also one of the largest towns in terms of population but this is probably due to the small distance between it and Dublin as I've already mentioned. The large population and the big footprint of the town lead to one of the things that Gorey is most famous for, the great buzz to be felt amongst the people. If you google anything from review pages to information pages about Gorey you will nearly always read something about the lovely people and the great buzz to be felt around the main street. This is because there is an amazing sense of community and closeness between the people. This also leads to an endless supply of <a href="todo.html">things to do</a>, from going on walks through the breathtaking scenery around the outskirts of the town to going for a pint in "Frenches", a pub considered one of the countries most traditional pubs, you'll never be left sitting down with nothing to do. The town itself is also filled with <a href="history.html">history</a> if that takes your interest, from battles to age old theatre groups, you can be sure that if <a href="history.html">history</a> is your thing you won't need to look any further than Gorey.</p>
